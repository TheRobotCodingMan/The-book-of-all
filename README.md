Hi Humans!

This project is really called SmallWiki (Because you will not find any information there). I started doing this website before I met Github. Thanks for coming here to my project, again *1*. because you are supporting us 💖. And if you got problems or requests, let us know! 😁 So we can improve our website! And wait for some months/years. 🤔 Because we will show our website to the public! 📢📢
